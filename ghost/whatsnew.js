// What's New: the text of the one-time screen Ghost shows on the first open after an update (ui.js, section
// "What's New"). Written at publish time, one entry per released version (the key is the exact
// CFBundleShortVersionString from ios/project.yml). A version without an entry shows nothing.
//
// Rules for the text (it is read by friends, not developers):
//   - 2 to 5 short bullets, plain words, what the person can now do or what got better. Start with the feature.
//   - `how` is optional: where to find it, one line ("Settings > Report a Bug or Idea"). Only when it needs it.
//   - No ticket numbers, test counts, file or function names, protocol terms.
//   - If a build ships several versions at once (e.g. 1.15.0 inside 1.16.0), put the bullets of all of them
//     in the newest entry.
